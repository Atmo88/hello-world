# hello-world
My first GitHub repo

Hello, this is the first change I'm doing ever. I'm gonna commit this one soon as well.
My name is Marek, I'm 23 y.o., eager to become a Python developer.
In this project I'm just learning how to use GitHub. Clone, commit, pull, push these are all new terms to me
but I'm working hard to get to know them.
